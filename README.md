In this project, we intend to create a model that would help emerging startups evaluate their 
probability of reaching the stage of being a Unicorn and having success based on the industry 
and country in which they have established their business or are planning to have an 
establishment.
The prime objectives of this phase of the project are:
• Finding the pattern between the countries and industries with the maximum number of 
emerging, existing, and exited Unicorn startups.
• Finding the most common reason for Unicorn startups to exit from the market.
• Finding the trend of startups entering and exiting from the league over the years.
• Create a model that would help the emerging startups in analyzing the probability of them 
rising to the status of one billion valuation in the ecosystem in which they would 
establish
