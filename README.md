In this project, we intend to create a model that would help emerging startups evaluate their 
probability of reaching the stage of being a Unicorn and having success based on the industry 
and country in which they have established their business or are planning to have an 
establishment.

### The prime objectives of this phase of the project are:
* Finding the pattern between the countries and industries with the maximum number of emerging, existing, and exited Unicorn startups.
* Finding the most common reason for Unicorn startups to exit from the market.
* Finding the trend of startups entering and exiting from the league over the years.
* Create a model that will assist emerging startups in determining the likelihood of becoming a unicorn company based on industry and country.

### Steps to run the project:
* Download the repository as a zip file.
* Open Anaconda Navigator. If you haven't installed it, install it from this link (https://www.anaconda.com/download)
* Launch VS Code from Anaconda Navigator.
* Open the project folder in VS Code.
* Open a new terminal from the terminal tab.
* Run the following codes
  *   ```conda info --envs``` (This will show the environment list. My environment name is 'base')
  *   ```conda activate base``` (Activate the environment name 'base')
  *   If you need to create a new environment run ```conda create --name ml``` 'ml' is the name of the new environment. Then run the code in the second point.
  *   ```pip install streamlit``` (Make sure Streamlit is installed in your Python environment.)
  *   ```streamlit run app.py``` (After running this the web app will open in the browser.)
